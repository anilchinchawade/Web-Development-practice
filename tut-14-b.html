    <h2>External CSS Example</h2>
    <p>This is an Example of External CSS in HTML</p>

    <!-- If you have all type of CSSs in single HTML file then highest precedence is taken by inline CSS
    and in case of Internal and External CSS the precedence goes to CSS written later than the CSS written prior.
    So to give highest precedence to some of the CSS elements written in early part you can add !important to 
    some styling element so that no other CSS can overwrite it -->
